If you are cloning this for the first time, download OpenJDK 12.0.2 from this website:
https://jdk.java.net/archive/

Make sure you download the right package for your operating system.

Then, move the JDK tar or zip you downloaded and move it into this directory (_PLACE_JDK_HERE). Unpack it into this directory. It should look like a folder with the proper zip when you are done.
